    "\n",
    "Your Task:\n",
    "You will be provided with a Fixed Trajectory consisting of a sequence of steps (Page Description, Action, Intent) and the Final Page's Accessibility (A11y) Tree.\n",
    "Your goal is to synthesize two critical components that make this trajectory look like a coherent, purposeful interaction:\n",
    "1.  **A High-Level Instruction:** The user's original command that perfectly motivates the observed actions.\n",
    "2.  **A Complete Answer:** The final response the agent would generate to conclude the task, proving the instruction has been fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### INPUT DATA\n",
    "You will receive:\n",
    "1.  `Trajectory`: A list of steps. Each step includes:\n",
    "    *   `Page Description`: What the page looked like before the action.\n",
    "    *   `Action`: The specific operation performed (e.g., click, type).\n",
    "    *   `Local Intent`: The immediate purpose of that specific action.\n",
    "2.  `Final A11y Tree`: The raw text representation of the webpage *after* the final action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. High-Level Instruction\n",
    "*   Goal: Synthesize a natural language instruction that implies the entire sequence of actions was necessary.\n",
    "*   Criteria:\n",
    "    *   Abstract & Goal-Oriented: Do not list the steps (e.g., \"Click A then B\"). Instead, describe the *objective* (e.g., \"Find the cheapest coffee maker\").\n",
    "    *   Consistency: The instruction must logically lead to the final state.\n",
    "    *   No IDs: Never mention element IDs (e.g., [74]) in the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Complete Answer\n",
    "*   Goal: Simulate the agent's Final Thought Process (Chain-of-Thought) that validates the result and issues the stop command.\n",
    "*   Format:\n",
    "    *   MUST start with: `\"Let's think step-by-step.\"`\n",
    "    *   MUST end with: `In summary, the next action I will perform is ` + ```stop [content]```.\n",
    "    *   NO text is allowed after the code block.\n",
    "*   Logic Types (Choose the one that fits the Final A11y Tree):\n",
    "    *   Type A (Information Seeking): If the instruction was to find specific text (e.g., a price, a date, a comment), extract this answer **verbatim** from the provided `Final A11y Tree`.\n",
    "    *   Type B (Task Completion/Navigation): If the instruction was to perform an action (e.g., \"Navigate to...\", \"Log in...\", \"Change settings\"), and the final state confirms this (or the second-to-last action completed it), the answer should summarize what was accomplished (e.g., \"I have successfully navigated to...\").\n",

    "  \"Instruction\": \"The synthesized high-level user command.\",\n",
    "  \"Answer\": \"Let's think step-by-step. [Reasoning about how the previous actions led to the current state and extracting the final answer or confirming completion].\\n\\nIn summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [The extracted answer or completion message]```\"\n",

This confirms the latest version number. \\n\\nIn summary, the next action I will perform is ```stop [3.11.4]```\"\n",
