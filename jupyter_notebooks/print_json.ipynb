Your goal is NOT to complete a specific task, but to explore the given website to understand its high-level layout and capabilities. You will build a map of the website by navigating through its main sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the information you'll have:\n",

      "`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.\n",
      "`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id.\n",
      "`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n",
      "`scroll [down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tab Management Actions:\n",
      "`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n",
      "`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n",
      "`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n",

      "URL Navigation Actions:\n",
      "`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n",
      "`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n",
      "`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n",

      "To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n",
      "1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n",
      "2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n",
      "3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n",
      "4. The core task is to try the web functions you find unclear or navigate to different sections of the site to explore other features.\n",
      "5. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n",
      "6. When you are on a page where the historical path already exists, avoid taking the same actions to explore more areas.\n"
