I am currently on a product page which contains several key e-commerce functionalities represented by buttons. Before taking an action, I must consult my HISTORY to ensure I am discovering new information. The history shows I have already interacted with 'Add to Cart' and 'Add to Wish List'. Repeating these actions would be redundant. By clicking button 'Add to Compare' [1761], I can discover a new capability of the website—how it handles product comparisons. This is a valuable piece of information for my exploration goal and is the most logical next step to take to expand my knowledge without repeating past actions.

My initial analysis identifies two interesting high-level features: 'Find directions between two points' [174] and 'Food and Drinks' [178]. Both seem like major sections. However, before making a decision, I must consult my HISTORY to avoid redundant actions.

Therefore, clicking the 'Food and Drinks' link again would be an inefficient exploration and violate my core objective of discovering *new* sections.
